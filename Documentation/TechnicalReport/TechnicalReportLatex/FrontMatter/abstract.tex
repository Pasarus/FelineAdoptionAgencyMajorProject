\section*{\centering Abstract}

This project is centred around the creation of an android mobile application (app), the main areas of work are based around the process by which the application is designed and how it is developed, as well as the final product being of high quality.

The app should follow a basic process for adopting or fostering cats, the adoption process inside of the app should take place in line with a current charity, such as Cats Protection \cite{CATSPROTECTION}, therefore it could easily be adapted for use by a cat (or pet) adoption charity. The app will be open-source and free to use under an Apache License 2.0\cite{APACHE2LICENSE}, for anyone to use for almost any purpose as long as copyright ownership is maintained.

This project entails the construction of a development tool-chain, mobile application prototyping, following good mobile design principles, utilising software engineering processes to provide a robust, stable and useful product. The tool-chain should include a fully automated testing, for unit tests, UI integration testing, and automatic code linting for errors, this tool-chain should use continuous integration software to allow for automated testing based on pushing to a GitHub\cite{GITHUB} repository, some examples include, Jenkins\cite{JENKINS}, Travis\cite{TRAVIS}, and Bitrise\cite{BITRISE}.

A user will be able to open the application, login, view their 'saved' cats and apply to adopt a cat that they found using the find a cat tool. This report will take you through the development of this application.
