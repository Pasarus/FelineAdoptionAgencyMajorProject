\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}


I am grateful to my supervisor, Chris Loftus, for the support and guidance that was consistently and well provided throughout the project, and my second marker for also helping with the marking and evaluation process.

I'd like to thank my family, friends and partner April for putting up with me being absent to complete my report and complete technical work during trying times at home.

I'd also like to thank the Open Source and the wider more general development community for producing amazing products and offering their support for others to use free of charge.

More specifically I would like to thank some people for their specific contributions:
