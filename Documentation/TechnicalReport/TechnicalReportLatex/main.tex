% Aberstwyth MMP Project Report Template for LaTeX
%
% Authors: Neil Taylor (nst@aber.ac.uk) and Dr. Hannah Dee (hmd1@aber.ac.uk) 
%
% This has been adapted from the Leeds Thesis template and the 
% Group Project template for Computer Science in Aberystywth University.
% 
% All comments and suggestions welcome.
%
% Template designed to be used with pdflatex: it may need alteration to
% run with a different LaTeX engine.
%
% Note - this is offered as a starting point for your work. You are not 
% required to use this template and can choose to create your own document 
% without it.

% This template is suitable for students with an engineering-style project, 
% which will be most students in the department. If your project is a research-oriented 
% project, look at the alternative template.

% To build document on the unix command line, run four commands:
 
% pdflatex mmp-report
% bibtex mmp-report
% pdflatex mmp-report
% pdflatex mmp-report

% you will end up with mmp-report.pdf. Before submitting, add your user ID as a prefix, 
% e.g. abc01-mmp-report.pdf 
\usepackage{StylesAndReferences/mmp-report}

% the following packages are used for citations - You only need to include one. 
%
% Use the cite package if you are using the numeric style (e.g. IEEEannot). 
% Use the natbib package if you are using the author-date style (e.g. authordate2annot). 
% Only use one of these and comment out or remove the other one.

%%%% Title and Section Colours %%%%
% Modify these values to change the colours used for title, sections and subsections.
% Each value is a range of 0-255 in RGB colourspace.
% Idea courtesy of discussion at

% If you prefer to have black headers, then comment out the following lines
\definecolor{mmpTitle}{RGB}{10, 85, 145}
\definecolor{mmpSection}{RGB}{10,85,155}
\definecolor{mmpSubsection}{RGB}{79,129,189}

\chapterfont{\color{mmpTitle}}  % sets colour of chapters
\sectionfont{\color{mmpSection}}  % sets colour of sections 
\subsectionfont{\color{mmpSubsection}} % sets colour subsections
\subsubsectionfont{\color{mmpSubsection}} % sets colour subsections

\chapter*{Appendices}
The appendices are for additional content that is useful to support the discussion in the report. It is material that is not necessarily needed in the body of the report, but its inclusion in the appendices makes it easy to access. 

For example, if you have developed a Design Specification document as part of a plan-driven approach for the project, then it would be appropriate to include that document as an appendix. In the body of your report you would highlight the most interesting aspects of the design, referring your reader to the full specification for further detail.

If you have taken an agile approach to developing the project, then you may be less likely to have developed a full requirements specification. Perhaps you use stories to keep track of the functionality and the 'future conversations'. It might not be relevant to include all of those in the body of your report. Instead, you might include those in an appendix. 

There is a balance to be struck between what is relevant to include in the body of your report and whether additional supporting evidence is appropriate in the appendices. Speak to your supervisor or the module coordinator if you have questions about this.
