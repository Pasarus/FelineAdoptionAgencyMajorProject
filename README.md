The Feline Adoption Agency app is my Major Project for the end of my Degree.

In the root directory there are 3 folders:
- Client
  - Where a Android Studio project is present that contains the contents of a not compiled application and all the code
- Documentation
  - Contains the Project Outline, the report images, PlantUML, prototype Copy, and the technical report folder. The technical report contains a technical report copy and the Latex used to compile the report.
- Server
  - Contains just the server scripts folder, this was originally aimed at containing a fully implemented server but that is no longer nessercary
  
In the root directory an APK should also be present which is the main method of installing the application.

All of this technical work is availiable on GitHub at: https://github.com/Pasarus/FelineAdoptionAgencyMajorProject
